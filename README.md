Soundcloud Path to Greatness

The game is that you are an up and coming soundcloud rapper and want to get signed and make it big in the rap game. You start out as a level one soundcloud rapper and want to make it to a level 100 signed with Kanye and become a G.O.O.D artist.
Levels/ Controls
The levels of the game are the various venues that you might go to or perform at. For instance, the first level can be at home performing to friends, then a party to more friends, a big party or small venue where you perform to strangers, and the final boss an actual concert or maybe the record label.
Every level is harder and has more clout to be gained but also more haters and more intricate rhymes and word play.
One possible aspect is in single player you can face off against boss soundcloud rappers who in addition to the haters can chase you and rap battle you and take your clout.
Objectives
Don't get caught by the haters, outrun them at all points. Progress through levels of clout by collecting clout items and also writing raps that are epic.
Essentially there are two parts of the game.
The first part is the rap writing part where you will be given a line and need to write a subsequent line that rhymes and is epic. The rap will be a set length and a set amount of lines, and you will be judged based off of what you entered rhymes. The better the rap, the more clout you gain from the writing portion of the game.
The second portion of the game is outrunning the haters to get more clout. You will perform at various venues and at while performing the game will be like a maze runner where you must navigate a generated venue where there will be moving objects, the haters, and also items that give you clout such as a sick supreme jacket or a signed Kanye Jesus is King Album that you can pick up. Running into haters and being attacked by haters will dip your clout level and in some cases knock you down a level.
There are also side objectives such as collecting sets of specific items that when combined can lead to even more clout.
For instance if one completes an entire supreme outfit their clout can double and haters half. Or if one finds the holy gucci headband the game is automatically over. There can be a multitude of item combinations that have varying implications that the player can look to complete.
Single Player
In single player your goal is to progress through multiple levels to become the successful soundcloud rapper. You have a running level of clout and can only move on to next levels when you surpass a certain threshold. You also can choose starter soundcloud rapper and rapper names that will give various boosts. For instance more controversial rappers will have more clout but more haters and. Depending on the choice of initial rapper the initial clout and hater numbers will change.
Multi Player
In multiplayer play, players compete by taking turns choosing different starter rappers and therefore difficulty of hater evading and starting clout. The players compete to reach a certain low threshold of clout. The players take turns writing raps, the topics and difficulty depend on rappers they choose. After the players each write a rap, the higher scored rap player is put into a venue while the lower scored player is the king hater and is given controls to chase the other player. The rap scores are doubled when added to total clout for each player. Then in the venue game, the player that won the rap can collect clout while evading the pc haters and the other playerâ€™s king hater. If the king hater wins the roles are reversed and the losing rap player is given an opportunity to collect clout to add to whatever they scored on the rap. Whoever ends the round with a higher clout is the winner.
Characters Spirits, etc
The rappers themselves are to be determined but some might be Lil Panini, Gekyume, 22 savage, kodack Yellow, Tay-K, 9ine6ix, etc.
Each rapper is given unique attributes and situations that determine the players starting condition. The non selected rappers will come up at various venues as bosses to beat or evae and overcome.


Overlay
The overlay for the rap writing part can be an epic looking overlay where there is a text box on top with a line and a text box below where the player types. There can be sick logos and other things on the screen that make it look cool.
For the venue running part of the game the screen can look like a 2d view of the venue with walls and objects etc where the player can navigate.
Experimental Part
The experimental part of the game is how the raps will be judged and taken in. There are a multitude of possible ways to take in strings and match them up with the base strings and see if they rhyme of flow well. This can be changed and experimented with.
